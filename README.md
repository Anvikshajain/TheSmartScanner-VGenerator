# TheSmartCity
The Smart City is the project that majorly saves time and does not keep the manual report of the visitors in the form of people's. In today's world, everything is changing from manual to automation. Therefore, the entries for the apartments or the smart city for the visitors should also be made fast and paperless. Therefore, the app is all about the entries in the smart city. The app features scanner and a visiting card.

The Smart City-V Generator- It is to be generated by the person living in the city and he/she should send it to the visitors for entry.

The Smart Scanner- This part scans the visiting card by the guard and the data is automatically uploaded to the database.[https://github.com/Anvikshajain/TheSmartScanner]
